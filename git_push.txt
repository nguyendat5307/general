2. Create a new repository
3. Create a file

	cd Demo
Create a file named README.md and write #Demo in it
	echo "#Demo" >> README.md
Tell computer that Demo is a directory managed by the Git program
	git init
**Tell the Git program you care about this file and want to track any changes from this

"first commit" is a message in commit that enables you to understand what you did with the file at that point
